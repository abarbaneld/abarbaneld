Whats up my apprentices! I've been programming for quite some time now, I have worked with a variety of programming languages. Pascal, QBasic, Apple Basic, C, Ruby, Python, TCL, Perl, Bash, Groovy, Java and Javascript to name a few.  
  
I have to admit my favorite language by far has been Javascript. My latest endeavor has been using Vue.js with Vuetify to build rapid application prototypes. I have experience with creating microservices and setting up CI/CD pipelines along with my normal duties.  
  
Kubernetes is another realm I have been adventuring in, I can build kubernetes(kubespray, microk8s, eks, aks, gks) clusters and I have constructed quite a few helm charts. Infrastructure as code is a god send (terraform). Thanks for stopping by, I hope to continue to grow my code base. Now I send you back to Kansas.
