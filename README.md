Welcome to my little area on Github. I have been programming most of my life now, I have used a variety of programming languages such as Pascal, QBasic, C, C++, Ruby, Python, TCL, Perl, Bash, Groovy, Java, Javascript, Go and Rust.
  
I have to admit my favorite language today is Go. My latest endeavor has been using Vue.js with Vuetify to build rapid application prototypes with a Go webserver backend. I have experience with creating microservices and setting up CI/CD pipelines along with my normal duties.
  
Kubernetes is another realm I have been adventuring in, I can build kubernetes(kubespray, microk8s, eks, aks, gks) clusters and I have constructed quite a few helm charts. Infrastructure as code is a god send (terraform/opentofu). Thanks for stopping by, I hope to continue to grow my code base. Now I send you back to Kansas.
